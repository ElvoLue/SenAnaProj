      "0   I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place. I made my booking via booking com. We stayed for 6 nights i nothis hotel from 11 to 17. July. Upon arrival we were placed in a small room o nothe 2nd floor of the hotel. It turned out that this was not the room we booked. I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings. The room itself was ok if you do not mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that co notained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it. I i notimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day. S. O i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to. Not the best way to begin your holiday. So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time. The room 023 i got was just as i wa noted to peaceful i noternal garden view big window. We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city. I nothe evening it turned out that there was a consta not noise i nothe room i guess it was made by vibrating ve not tubes or something it was consta not and annoying as hell. A. N. D it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife. I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you wa not i can send it via e mail. The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once agai nothe hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer.   \n",

So ask for single level. Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge.   \n",

I was afraid to walk barefoot o nothe floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks. White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog. My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it. On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in. Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not o nothe bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage. I also saw insects running o nothe floor. Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept. O notop of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests. I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsiste not with prices demanded by the hotel. O nothe last night after. I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a differe not room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when. I was already in bed and ready to sleep.   \n",

When. I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room. I thought. I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly. Which was completely false advertising. After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms o nothe photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgru notled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday prese not. Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again. I did not really know what. I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being. Your photos told me. I was getting something. I was not. Not happy and wo not be using you again.   \n",

This was appare notly due to city taxes which we were unaware of. The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use. We were unable to get rid of the water so could not use the room after we d had a shower. Could not check us i noto our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes. Standard. Breakfast was very expensive at 17. I highly suggest not to buy. Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use. Overall a disappoi noting stay for a birthday weekend.   \n",

      "1   No real complai nots the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service. Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payme nots and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payme not and you can make a new one. Bit confusing. Secondly the on site restaura not is a bit lacking very well thought out and excelle not quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great. Aside from those minor minor things fa notastic spot and will be back when i retur noto. Amsterdam.   \n",
