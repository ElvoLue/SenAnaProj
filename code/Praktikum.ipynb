      "0      I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place. I made my booking via booking com. We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17. July. Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel. It turned out that this was not the room we booked. I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings. The room itself was ok if you do notmind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it. I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day. S. O i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to. Not the best way to begin your holiday. So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time. The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window. We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city. In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell. A. N. D it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife. I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail. The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer.   \n",

So ask for single level. Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge.   \n",

I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks. White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog. My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it. On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in. Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage. I also saw insects running on the floor. Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept. On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests. I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel. On the last night after. I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when. I was already in bed and ready to sleep.   \n",

When. I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room. I thought. I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly. Which was completely false advertising. After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present. Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again. I did notreally know what. I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being. Your photos told me. I was getting something. I wasn t. Not happy and wo notbe using you again.   \n",

      "1      No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service. Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one. Bit confusing. Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great. Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to. Amsterdam.   \n",
