## Sentiment analysis project of hotel reviews by aspect extraction ##


## To build the project, simply run the code in "Praktikum.ipynb" ##


## Extracted data of the ten most reviewed hotels is already present in the document "hotelFinalResults" ##
   # We did not run the model for all the 1400+ hotels, but this can simply be done by tweaking the code  #
   
   
## In the output folder there are already several plots of data for the ten most reviewed hotels. They are the examples used in the final presentation ##


## The aspect extraction was mostly done by already written rules. References are in the source code ##


#Note: The include folder is outside the project scope because we cannot push the entire data to git, so we did not include it in the project repository and left it 'outside'#
